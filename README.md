## Phila Cultural Fund map 

Mapping the distribution of Philadelphia Cultural Fund grant funds. 

### Note
This project is not directly affiliated with the Philadelphia Cultural Fund or the City of Philadelphia.  

### Purpose

This project is part of the [OSMP2015 program] (https://codeforphilly.org/projects/open_source_mentorship_program_2015).  The purpose of the program, and this project, is to gain experience with open-source tools and civic projects.

The purpose of the Philadelphia Cultural Fund Map is to add a layer of transparency to the Philadelphia Cultural Fund's grant-making process.  While many grantmakers restrict their funds to organizations in a given geographical area (i.e. only giving to orgs in Pennsylvania or the Philadelphia region), there is only occasionally a discussion of how funds are distributed within those boundaries.

### Models

The practice of mapping grant funds is not new or uncommon.  Many foundations, particularly those with a global reach, use maps to communicate impact or illustrate areas of interest.

[The Foundation Center's Foundations Map tool] (http://maps.foundationcenter.org/home.php) is comprehensive and powerful.  It is accessible only via subscription, but some foundations make their Foundation Center map available on their websites.

Examples of Foundation Center maps include:

 *  [Charles Stewart Mott Foundation] (http://www.mott.org1/grantsandguidelines/ExploreGrants/maps)
 * [Zellerbach Family Foundation] (http://zff.org/grantmaking/)

Other examples (not using Foundations Map tool): 

 *  [FFA Environmental Grants] (http://www.communitywalk.com/map/1743255)
 *  [Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation] (http://mrbf.org/grants)
 *  [US Dept of Energy] (http://science.energy.gov/universities/interactive-grants-map/)

### Data Sources

The data set was compiled from the [Philadelphia Cultural Fund's website] (http://www.philaculturalfund.org/), grantees' websites, and their tax form 990's, which are available to the public via [Guidestar] (http://www.guidestar.org/).

### Project Status
